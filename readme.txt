Team Map Planner is a program that will eventually allow people to draw together in real time like people can write together using google docs. 

The Program was started and is mostly coded by Rafael09D. 

As of 4/29/15: If you want to run the program you have to go to the latest version (Version 5 at the time) and run the MapDrawerCore.java file.
